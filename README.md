# Assignment: Create an Application for Calculating Permutations and Combinations
AD 315

## Objective
Create an application that calculates permutations and combinations based on user input. The application should allow the user to enter the values for n (total items) and r (items to be chosen or arranged) and then display the results.

## Requirements
- The application should take two inputs from the user: (total items) and r (items to be chosen or arranged).
- The application should calculate and display:
  - The number of permutations P(n, r)
  - The number of combinations C(n, r)
- The application can be implemented as either a web application or a terminal application.
